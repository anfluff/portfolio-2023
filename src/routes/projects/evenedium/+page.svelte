    You are the leader of a small Naakari tribe that is trying to survive and glorify itself in the ruthless wild lands of Camotlan, dug up by a long war. Your formation begins on the ruins of the past, and you build the foundation of your people here and now from the ruins of bygone cultures.

    The game is played on a field consisting of hexes. Hexes are combined into 3x5 blocks. The hexes are connected by roads.
    Blocks can be connected in any way to have at least one road between them.
    This allows the playing field to be as varied as possible.
    <br>
    All hexes contain a landscape. Initially, it is closed, but you can spend the development of the hex and the landscape will open.
    With each development, a random event occurs: there can be either a find, a dilemma, or a challenge.
    <br>
    Around the field laid hexes with achievements. The legendary epic of the tribe is formed by these.

    The whole visual style is based on the opposition of two elements - magical (teal, smooth, fluid) and steampunk (red, sharp, rough).

    The game comes with two rulebooks: a Quick Start and Full Rules.
    In a Quick Start, we tried to clearly and colorfully describe the main concepts of the game.

  <div class="text">
    The Full Rules fully describe all the mechanics and their features.

  <div class="text">
    A strategy game, of course, involves the construction of buildings and hiring units. A hint card will tell you the costs and features.
    On its reverse side, the player will find all the achievement: the verses of the song.

    Event cards. All but four are divided in half. The upper part describes the ongoing event: either a find, or a dilemma, or a challenge.
    The lower one shows an improvement. It could be magical or technological. Under special conditions it can be adopted by the player.
    <br>
    The four exclusion cards are rare relics that can strengthen the player's tribe.

    Our tribe is not human at all. It's Naakari! Creatures living in an unusual world all their lives.
    Their body can adapt according to need, and then their appearance and the appearance of their buildings have completely unusual outlines.

    Creature tokens are colored on a black background. Building tokens are black on color.
    The reverse side of the tokens is a stroke. The tokens are turned over when they have performed all the actions possible in this turn.
