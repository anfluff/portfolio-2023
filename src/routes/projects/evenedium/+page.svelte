    Evenedium is a classic strategy board game.
    <br>
    You are the leader of a small Naakari tribe that is trying to survive and glorify itself in the ruthless wild lands of Camotlan, dug up by a long war.
    Your formation begins on the ruins of the past, and you build the foundation of your people here and now from the ruins of bygone cultures.

    The game is designed for 2-4 players. One session can take from 30 minutes to 2 hours.
    <br>
    Explore the map, find artifacts from past eras, compete with opponents, and most importantly: write your own legendary epic about it!

    The game is played on a field consisting of hexes. Hexes are combined into 3x5 blocks. The hexes are connected by roads.
    Blocks can be connected in any way to have at least one road between them.

    The whole visual style is based on the opposition of two elements - magical (teal, smooth, fluid) and steampunk (red, sharp, rough).
