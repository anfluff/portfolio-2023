<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="project-story">
  <div class="text">
    In <strong>2012</strong> I graduated from the <strong>St.Petersburg Polytechnic University</strong>
    and got my <strong>MaSc</strong> with <strong>First Class Honours</strong> in <strong>Applied Informatics and Multimedia Design</strong>.
    I started working as a web developer in my last course, so by now I have <strong>more then 10 years of experience</strong>.
    I like to work in <strong>small teams</strong> on <strong>ambitious tasks</strong>.
    I prefer to work as <strong>fullstack frontend developer</strong> — manage all the UX, UI and then the Frontend.
    Currently I’m looking for a job because the last startup I was working in didn't take off.
    At the moment I am in Georgia. <strong>Looking for a position with relocation</strong>.
